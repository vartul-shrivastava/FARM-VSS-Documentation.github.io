Introduction
============

Welcome to the FARM-VSS Documentation!

FARM-VSS, or the **Fuzzy Association Rule Mining - Visualization and Summarization Suite**, is a comprehensive toolkit developed for the analysis and generation of association rules from numerical datasets. By integrating fuzzy logic principles with AI-driven summarization, FARM-VSS offers an advanced yet user-friendly platform for uncovering meaningful patterns and associations in data. This documentation provides a structured guide to understanding, installing, and using FARM-VSS effectively.

Purpose
-------

The primary objective of FARM-VSS is to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights by:

- Applying fuzzy logic to accommodate uncertainties and nuances in numerical datasets.
- Generating weighted association rules to emphasize key aspects of the data.
- Enhancing interpretability through visualizations and AI-assisted summaries.
- Supporting decision-making processes with reliable, data-driven outputs.

Key Features
------------

1. **Data Handling**:
   - Seamless data upload and preprocessing.
   - Support for numerical datasets with customizable partitioning and range selection.

2. **Fuzzy Partitioning**:
   - Automatic or manual fuzzy partitioning of numerical attributes.
   - Visualization of fuzzy membership functions for better interpretability.

3. **Association Rule Mining**:
   - Comprehensive Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (FARM) using configurable thresholds.
   - Weighted FARM (W-FARM) for incorporating domain-specific importance through weights.

4. **Rule Exploration**:
   - Brute-force grid exploration of support and confidence thresholds.
   - Heatmap visualizations to analyze the impact of varying thresholds on rule generation.

5. **AI Integration**:
   - Utilization of locally hosted AI models (via Ollama) for summarizing generated rules.
   - Customizable AI prompts to tailor summarization to specific requirements.

6. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Dynamic plots for rule significance and certainty analysis.
   - Clear and intuitive user interfaces for managing fuzzy partitions, rules, and summaries.
